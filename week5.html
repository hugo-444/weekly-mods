                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Read each text aloud 3 times, focusing on smooth pronunciation.</li>

        <div class="label">Culture & Context Focus</div>
        <p>
            Read a short article or watch a video about the role of storytelling in Arab culture:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hakawati traditions (traditional storytellers)</li>
            <li>Oral storytelling in cafes and public spaces</li>
            <li>The connection between storytelling and preserving cultural memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Reflect: Note any parallels with Mexican oral traditions and <span class="arabic-term">cuentos</span>. 
            How do both cultures use stories to pass down knowledge and values?
        </p>
