            You have completed 15 weeks of intensive Arabic study. This is a significant achievement.

        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
            Remember: language learning is a journey, not a destination. Keep practicing, stay curious, 
            and continue exploring the rich cultures of the Arabic-speaking world.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #5e4d3d;">
